1.What is the main reason to use a random forest versus a decision tree? (<= 50 words)
A decision tree has the risk of overfitting and gets high variance. Random Forests aggregate many decision trees, are trained on different subsets of the data, and use a random subset of features to limit overfitting and reduce variance.
2.How long did your random forest take to run? (in seconds)
132 seconds.
3.What accuracy (to two decimal places, xx.xx%) were you able to obtain?
73.06%
